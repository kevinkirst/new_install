- nano /etc/default/grub
# swap line:
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
	# for:
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi_backlight=video"
		# this fixes slider on brightness pannel but F11 & F12 still not working
		# creates '/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0' if it doesn't exist
# inside '/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0'
	# changing group of 'brightness' from root to kirst
	# this file contains a number ranging from 0-100 representing brightness percentage
	- sudo chgrp -v kirst brightness
	# adding write permissions to 'kirst' group for 'brightness' file
	- sudo chmod 664 brightness

	# ALL of this so that:
	- $ echo 50 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
	# will change the brightness to 50%...now to automate it and make a custom command for it
		# it shall be called 'sun'
DONE - # create udev rule and copy it to /lib/udev/rules.d/
reload udev (or reboot machine)
	- sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo service udev restart && sudo udevadm trigger
# test udev rule
	# applying udev rules somehow broke power management brightness interface...like wtf???
	# after rebooting once more it came back to normal...ok like wtf again, but in a good way??

# script to make all these changes and copy sun to /usr/bin
